/*
& bitwise AND The bits in the result are set to 1 if the corresponding
bits in the two operands are both 1.

| bitwise inclusive OR The bits in the result are set to 1 if at least one of
the corresponding bits in the two operands is 1.

^ bitwise exclusive OR The bits in the result are set to 1 if only one of
the corresponding bits in the two operands is 1.

<< left shift Shifts the bits of the first operand left by the number
of bits specified by the second operand.

>> right shift Shifts the bits of the first operand right by the number
of bits specified by the second operand.

~ oneâ€™s complement All 0 bits are set to 1 and 1 bits are set to 0.

Example in c:
unsigned short x = 5, y = 2, z; //in binary 5 is 101 and 2 is 10
z = x & y; //result: 0
1
z = 5 | y; //result: 7
z = 5 ^ 1; //result: 4

//think about in binary form
